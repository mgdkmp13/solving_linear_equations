# solving_linear_equations
This project implements and analyzes three methods for solving linear systems of equations: two iterative methods and one direct method. The goal is to compare their accuracy, convergence speed, and computational efficiency.

Implemented Methods:
- Jacobi Method (iterative)
- Gauss-Seidel Method (iterative)
- LU Factorization (direct)

The project includes data visualization and performance analysis.

Technologies
- C++ – Implementation of all computation methods.
- MATLAB – Data visualization and plotting results.
